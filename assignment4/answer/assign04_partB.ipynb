    "In this assignment you will write some Python statements within this Jupyter Notebook that are answers to the posed programming questions. By saving what you have written into the notebook, and submitting the resulting IPython file via conneX, the teaching team will be able to evaluate your work.\n",

    "You are encouraged to create your own notebooks in order to experiment with programming ideas. Once you have solutions that you wish to submit, they can be copy-and-pasted into this notebook. You should, however, always ensure your Python statements do work by evaluating them within this notebook.\n",
